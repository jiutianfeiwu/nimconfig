# NOTE:  After this first comment section ends, COMMENTS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED.
#
# NOTE: Stanzas follow these rules:
#       1. Stanza names must be at the beginning of the line and end in a colon.
#       2. Comments may be after the colon, but THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE!!!! other
#          than here in the header.  Even then, don't expect those comments
#          to be put back where they were after BOS install gets done processing
#          this file.  We reserve the right to mangle and ignore all comments
#          which are not placed in this header.
#       3. Stanza fields are on lines following stanza names,  Stanza fields
#          must NOT begin at the beginning of the line, but must have tabs or
#          blanks in front of them.
#       4. There can be no blank lines between field lines of the same stanza.
#       5. A blank line MUST separate each stanza.  In other words, after the
#          last field line of the stanza, a blank line must follow before the
#          line containing the stanza name of the next stanza.
